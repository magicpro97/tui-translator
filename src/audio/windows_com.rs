//! RAII guard for a per-thread COM apartment on Windows.
//!
//! # Background — issue #723
//!
//! The `wasapi` crate exposes [`wasapi::initialize_mta`] (wraps
//! `CoInitializeEx(COINIT_MULTITHREADED)`) and [`wasapi::deinitialize`]
//! (wraps `CoUninitialize`) as two independent functions. The crate does
//! not auto-pair them. Before this guard existed, the codebase called
//! `initialize_mta` from five production sites and three test sites but
//! never called `deinitialize`, leaving the per-thread COM apartment
//! ref count permanently +1 on the test thread.
//!
//! On GitHub-hosted `windows-latest` runners this manifested as a
//! `STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION` (0xC0000005) during process teardown, after
//! every test had already passed. Real Windows machines were
//! intermittently affected; release builds avoided the crash because
//! `device_watchdog`'s real `IMMNotificationClient` registration was
//! gated to release-only builds (e474706), removing the most complex
//! COM participant from the test path.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // production code
//! let _com = audio::windows_com::ComApartmentGuard::enter()?;
//! // ... use WASAPI / MMDevice APIs ...
//! // guard drops at end of scope, calling wasapi::deinitialize
//! ```
//!
//! For the watchdog event-pump thread (which creates COM objects that
//! outlive the guard and move to another thread), use
//! [`ComApartmentGuard::leak`] instead. That variant skips the
//! `CoUninitialize` on Drop because the COM apartment must outlive the
//! objects that were created in it (otherwise the cross-apartment
//! Release on the receiving thread segfaults — see comment on
//! `WatchdogInner::drop` in `audio/device_watchdog.rs`).
//!
//! # Thread safety
//!
//! `ComApartmentGuard` is intentionally `!Send + !Sync`. The
//! `PhantomData<*const ()>` field prevents the type system from letting
//! a caller move the guard across thread boundaries, which would corrupt
//! the per-thread COM ref count. The guard's lifetime is tied to a
//! single thread's call stack.

/// RAII guard that pairs `wasapi::initialize_mta()` with
/// `wasapi::deinitialize()` on `Drop`.
